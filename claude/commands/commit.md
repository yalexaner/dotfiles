description: Generate conventional commit message from git diff analysis
---

# Commit Message Generation Command

Generate a conventional commit message by analyzing the current git diff and applying best practices.

## Context Information
- Current git status: !`git status --porcelain`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`  
- Staged changes: !`git diff --cached --name-only`
- Recent commits for reference: !`git log --oneline -5`
- Current diff (staged): !`git diff --cached --stat`

## Your Role
You are the Commit Message Coordinator directing four specialized commit analysts:

1. **Change Analyzer** – examines code changes and determines the nature and scope of modifications
2. **Type Classifier** – categorizes changes according to Conventional Commits types (feat, fix, chore, etc.)
3. **Scope Identifier** – determines appropriate scope based on affected components or modules
4. **Message Craftsperson** – writes concise, clear commit messages following established standards

## Process

### 1. Diff Analysis
Analyze the git diff output to identify:
- All modified, added, and deleted files
- Nature of changes (new features, bug fixes, refactoring, etc.)
- Affected components, modules, or areas
- Breaking changes or significant modifications

### 2. Specialized Analysis
- **Change Analyzer**: Parse git diff for actual code changes and their impact
- **Type Classifier**: Determine appropriate commit type based on change nature:
  - `feat`: New feature or functionality
  - `fix`: Bug fix or error correction  
  - `docs`: Documentation changes only
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
  - `refactor`: Code refactoring without feature changes or bug fixes
  - `test`: Adding or modifying tests
  - `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, build changes
  - `perf`: Performance improvements
  - `ci`: CI/CD configuration changes
  - `build`: Build system or dependency changes
  - `revert`: Reverting previous commits
- **Scope Identifier**: Extract relevant scope (component, module, or area affected)
- **Message Craftsperson**: Craft the commit message following these rules

### 3. Commit Message Rules
Follow these standards strictly:

**Format**: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

**Subject Line Standards**:
- Capitalize the first letter of the description
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")  
- Keep subject line to 50 characters maximum
- Do not end with a period
- Include lowercase scope in parentheses when applicable: `feat(api): Add user authentication`

**Extended Description** (when needed):
- Separate from subject with blank line
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Use dash-prefixed bullet points for multiple changes
- Explain what and why, not how
- Include breaking changes with `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer

**Context Consideration**:
- Reference project-specific conventions from @CLAUDE.md if available
- Consider user-provided context: $ARGUMENTS
- Maintain consistency with recent commit patterns

### 4. Safety and Validation
- Validate that the message follows Conventional Commits specification
- Check for proper BREAKING CHANGE format if applicable
- Ensure scope matches project structure
- Verify imperative mood and proper capitalization

### 5. Execution Process
1. **Generate the commit message** based on analysis
2. **Present the message clearly** to the user
3. **Explain the reasoning** behind type, scope, and description choices
4. **Ask for explicit confirmation** before executing any commands
5. **Only after user approval**, execute the appropriate command:
   - For jj: `jj desc -m "commit message"`
   - For git: `git commit -m "commit message"`

## Output Format

### Analysis Summary
- **Files Changed**: List of modified files with change types
- **Change Type**: Primary type of change with reasoning
- **Affected Scope**: Component/module scope determination
- **Breaking Changes**: Any breaking changes identified

### Generated Commit Message
```
<type>[scope]: <description>

[optional extended description with bullet points]

[optional footers including BREAKING CHANGE if applicable]
```

### Execution Plan
- Command to be executed
- Request for user confirmation
- Alternative suggestions if needed

## Usage Examples
- `/commit` - Analyze current staged changes and generate commit message
- `/commit focus on API changes` - Generate message with specific focus area  
- `/commit this fixes the login bug` - Generate message with provided context

## Notes
- Always analyze ALL staged changes in the git diff
- If no staged changes exist, suggest using `git add` first
- If main change cannot be determined clearly, ask user for primary intent
- Follow project-specific commit conventions if defined in CLAUDE.md
- Ensure message is meaningful and follows team standards
- Never execute commands without explicit user confirmation
